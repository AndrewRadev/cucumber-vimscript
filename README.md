This project contains step definitions that can be used to spawn a Vim instance
and control it through code. The actual work is done by the
[vimrunner gem](https://github.com/AndrewRadev/vimrunner).

The steps are still only a few and will be updated as I use them in my own vim
projects, but of course, any contributions are more than welcome.
